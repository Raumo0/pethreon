# Pethreon: recurring payments on Ethereum

Support your favourite creator (an artist, a musician, a programmer) in a regular fasion.

Compared to centralized alternatives, Pethreon:

* **requires no trust**: a smart contract can not run away with the money
* **respects privacy**: neither supporters nor creators have to reveal their personal information
* **offers lower fees**: apart from Ethereum transaction cost, there are no fees 

This is how it works.

A *supporter*:

* deposits ether into a smart contract
* makes a pledge to support a creator by regular payments
* can cancel the pledge anytime and get the remaining funds back

A *creator*:

* publishes an Ethereum address and waits for supporters to pledge
* can withdraw the available amount of ether anytime
